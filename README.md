# QuantumDB - A Document Data Store

QuantumDB is a Web-based Document Data Store used to manage and process large volumes of data through CRUD actions combined with useful tools such as file upload/download, JSON editor with syntax checking and prettify features. The software allows developers and users to create collections to group related documents and datasets together. The product also has the ability to filter and query data efficiently. QuantumDB's backend is hosted on an AWS server which allows multiple users from different devices to interact with the frontend and make live changes to the database simultaneously.
