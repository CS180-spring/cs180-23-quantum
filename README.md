# QuantumDB - A Document Data Store

QuantumDB is a Web-based Document Data Store used to manage and process large volumes of data. The product will be able to create documents, read documents, update documents, as well as deleting documents. The product will also have the ability to filter and query data. We will use AWS EC2 to host our application, and it will just be used just like a PC (so we don't have to run it all the time). The data will be stored on the virtual server and developers will be able to interact with QuantumDB using a REST API provided to them.
